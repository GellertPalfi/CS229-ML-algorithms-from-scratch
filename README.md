# Visualizations:
Because looking at code is not the most interesting thing,  
here are some visualizations (Code included in the repo) that I made with my implementations of the algorithms.

## Linear regression line fit:

## Gradient descent searching for optimal parameters on the error surface in the weight space:

# Disclaimer
There are very simple and primitve implementations of the algorithms, the ones you find in popular ml packages such as sci-kit learn were refined and optimized for years by experts and thus any of these implementations should only be used for learning purposes.

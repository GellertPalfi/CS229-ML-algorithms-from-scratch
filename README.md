# CS229 code follow along
Following along the [Stanford-CS229](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU) youtube playlist  
and implementing some of the machine learning algorithms with the math shown there in python.

# Algorithms implemented
 - Linear regression
 - Logistic regression
 - Naive Bayes
 - Support Vector Machine
 - Simple Neural Networks
 - Backpropagation
 - Batch Gradient Descent

# Visualizations:
Because looking at code is not the most interesting thing,  
here are some visualizations(Code included) that I made with my implementations of the algorithms.

## Linear regression fit:
